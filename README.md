### Kennedy Saidimu - Interactive Developer Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. It's a single-page application designed to showcase my projects, technical skills, and unique professional journey as a Biomedical Engineer and Web Developer.

The portfolio is built with a focus on interactivity, animations, and a clean, modern aesthetic to create an engaging user experience.

### üöÄ Key Features

- **Project Showcase:** An interactive carousel to display recent work with titles, descriptions, and technology stacks.
- **Interactive Tech Stack:** A dynamic, draggable network graph that visualizes my technical skills and their relationships. Users can drag nodes around, and hovering over a skill highlights its connections.
- **Animated Career Roadmap:** A scroll-driven SVG path animation that reveals my career and learning trajectory, from core foundations to future goals in DevSecOps and cloud architecture.
- **"Dual Engine" Philosophy:** A unique section that connects my background in Biomedical Engineering (systems thinking, fault tolerance) with my software development practices.
- **Responsive Design:** A fully responsive layout for optimal viewing on all devices. The roadmap section gracefully degrades to a horizontal scroll on mobile for a better user experience.
- **Modern Aesthetics:** Utilizes glassmorphism, subtle glows, and smooth animations to create a polished and professional look.
